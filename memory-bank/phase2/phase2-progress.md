# Phase 2 Progress: SASS Variable Standardization

## Overview

This document tracks the progress of Phase 2 of the SASS Variable Standardization project, which focuses on creating enhanced systems for spacing, typography, and shadows, as well as updating components to use these new systems.

## Current Status

**Status**: Implementation (Component Updates)  
**Expected completion**: 2025-04-15  
**Last updated**: 2025-03-17

## Completed Tasks

### Foundation Systems

- âœ… Created enhanced systems for spacing, typography, and shadows in `_tokens.scss`
- âœ… Implemented function and mixin libraries for each system
- âœ… Created comprehensive utility classes for spacing, typography, and shadows
- âœ… Added CSS variables for shadows to enable theme switching
- âœ… Implemented animation system foundation with timing and easing functions

### Documentation

- âœ… Completed spacing system specification
- âœ… Completed typography system specification
- âœ… Completed shadow system specification
- âœ… Created animation system specification
- âœ… Created component update plan
- âœ… Created style guide template

### Component Updates

- âœ… Header Component (Updated 2024-05-15, Reverted 2025-03-17)
- âœ… NavBar Component (Updated 2024-05-26)
- âœ… Footer Component (Updated 2024-05-27)
- âœ… About Component (Updated 2025-03-17)

### Bug Fixes

- âœ… Fixed SASS compilation error by adding missing `line-height()` function
- âœ… Fixed dependency issues by adding yocto-queue package
- âœ… Fixed Markdown linting issues in documentation
- âœ… Consolidated typography files for better organization
- âœ… Fixed SASS deprecation warnings in ConflictMediation component
- âœ… Fixed undefined mixin errors by adding proper imports
- âœ… Fixed shadow token implementation for dark theme (2024-05-28)
- âœ… Fixed responsive typography issues in mobile view (2024-05-26)
- âœ… Fixed SCSS syntax issues in media queries (2025-03-17)

## In Progress

- ðŸ”„ Implementing animation utility classes based on the specification (50% complete)
- ðŸ”„ Updating Portfolio component to use the new token system (30% complete)
- ðŸ”„ Creating comprehensive user-facing documentation (40% complete)
- ðŸ”„ Developing glass effect mixin for standardized implementation (Not started)

## Next 3 Tasks

1. **Start Portfolio Component Update** (ETA: 2025-03-30)
   - Audit all hardcoded values
   - Create implementation plan
   - Update component structure to use token system
   - Test across all breakpoints

2. **Finish Animation Utility Classes** (ETA: 2025-03-25)
   - Complete implementation of fade animations
   - Implement slide animations
   - Create scale and transform animations
   - Test animations for performance

3. **Create Glass Effect Mixin** (ETA: 2025-03-20)
   - Standardize glass effect implementation
   - Create consistent variables for blur, background, and border
   - Add comprehensive documentation

## Implementation Strategy

For the remaining work, we will follow this strategy:

1. **Component Updates**: Focus on completing the most visible components first (Portfolio, Work) before moving to less frequently viewed components.

2. **Selective Token Application**: Apply the token system selectively based on component requirements and aesthetic preferences.

3. **Animation System**: Complete the animation utility classes and integrate with existing components, prioritizing the most impactful animations.

4. **Documentation**: Update documentation as each component is completed, ensuring it accurately reflects the implementation.

## Success Metrics

- Number of components updated to use the token system (Target: 100%, Current: 40%)
- Reduction in hardcoded values (Target: 95% reduction, Current: ~60%)
- Consistent spacing across components (In progress)
- Improved responsive behavior (In progress)
- Simplified component styles (In progress)
- Easier maintenance and updates (In progress)

## Recent Changes

- **[2025-03-17]**
  - Reverted Header component to original styling based on user preference
  - Completed About component update with token system
  - Replaced all hardcoded values with spacing, typography, and shadow tokens
  - Improved responsive behavior using breakpoint mixins
  - Fixed SCSS syntax issues in media queries
  - Updated progress documentation
  
- **[2024-05-28]**

  - Refined component update plan
  
- **[2024-05-27]**
  - Completed Footer component update
  - Added file references to documentation
  - Fixed animation timing issues

## Key Learnings

- **Aesthetic Preservation**: Some components have unique styling needs that work better with their original implementation. A hybrid approach allows us to maintain the desired aesthetic while improving the overall system.

- **User Preferences**: User feedback is critical in determining whether a component should use the token system or maintain its original styling.

- **Balanced Approach**: A balanced approach that respects both system consistency and component-specific requirements leads to better user acceptance.
