## Implementation Patterns

### Visual Effects Architecture
- Visual effects (vignette, Moiree) are implemented at the application root level in the `AppContent` component
- Effects should remain independent of authentication state for consistent aesthetics
- Z-index hierarchy: Navbar (70) > Vignette effects (30) > Moiree effect (5)
- Pointer events are disabled on visual effects to allow interaction with underlying elements
