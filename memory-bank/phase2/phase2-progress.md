# Phase 2 Progress: SASS Variable Standardization

## Overview

This document tracks the progress of Phase 2 of the SASS Variable Standardization project, which focuses on creating enhanced systems for spacing, typography, and shadows, as well as updating components to use these new systems.

## Current Status

**Status**: Planning (Reassessment)  
**Expected completion**: TBD (Under review)  
**Last updated**: 2025-03-17

## Recent Developments

We have decided to revert the recent changes related to blur tokens, glass effect system, and About component updates to reassess our approach to Phase 2 implementation. The changes were causing unforeseen compilation issues and disrupting the development workflow. We'll be taking a more incremental approach moving forward.

## Completed Tasks

### Foundation Systems

- âœ… Created enhanced systems for spacing, typography, and shadows in `_tokens.scss`
- âœ… Implemented function and mixin libraries for each system
- âœ… Created comprehensive utility classes for spacing, typography, and shadows
- âœ… Added CSS variables for shadows to enable theme switching
- âœ… Implemented animation system foundation with timing and easing functions

### Documentation

- âœ… Completed spacing system specification
- âœ… Completed typography system specification
- âœ… Completed shadow system specification
- âœ… Created animation system specification
- âœ… Created component update plan
- âœ… Created style guide template

### Component Updates

- âœ… Header Component (Updated 2024-05-15, Reverted 2024-05-15)
- âœ… NavBar Component (Updated 2024-05-26)
- âœ… Footer Component (Updated 2024-05-27)

### Bug Fixes

- âœ… Fixed SASS compilation error by adding missing `line-height()` function
- âœ… Fixed dependency issues by adding yocto-queue package
- âœ… Fixed Markdown linting issues in documentation
- âœ… Consolidated typography files for better organization
- âœ… Fixed SASS deprecation warnings in ConflictMediation component
- âœ… Fixed undefined mixin errors by adding proper imports
- âœ… Fixed shadow token implementation for dark theme (2024-05-28)
- âœ… Fixed responsive typography issues in mobile view (2024-05-26)
- âœ… Fixed SCSS syntax issues in media queries (2025-03-17)

## In Progress

- ðŸ”„ Reassessing implementation strategy and timeline (Active)
- ðŸ”„ Revising component update plan (Active)
- ðŸŸ¡ Animation utility classes implementation (On hold)
- ðŸŸ¡ Portfolio component update (On hold)
- ðŸŸ¡ User-facing documentation (On hold)

## Next Steps

1. **Revise Implementation Strategy** (No ETA yet)
   - Develop a more incremental approach to Phase 2 implementation
   - Create a realistic timeline with clear milestones
   - Establish priority for component updates

2. **Create Test Protocol** (No ETA yet)
   - Develop standardized test cases for token system changes
   - Create verification process for component updates
   - Establish criteria for successful implementation

3. **Focused Documentation Update** (No ETA yet)
   - Update documentation to reflect new strategy
   - Create clearer guidelines for component updates
   - Ensure documentation is accessible to all team members

## Implementation Strategy (Under Review)

Our implementation strategy is currently under review. We will develop a revised approach that addresses these key concerns:

1. **Incremental Implementation**: Take a more gradual approach to implementing the token system.

2. **Testing Protocol**: Establish comprehensive testing procedures for all changes.

3. **Component Prioritization**: Carefully assess which components should be updated and in what order.

4. **User Experience**: Ensure changes don't disrupt the user experience or development workflow.

## Success Metrics (Under Review)

Our success metrics will be reassessed as part of our strategy review. We will likely focus more on:

- Stability and reliability of the codebase
- Incremental improvements to component styling
- Developer experience and ease of maintenance
- User experience continuity

## Recent Changes

### July 10, 2023

- **Restored Vignette Blur Effect**: The original vignette blur implementation was restored with proper class naming (using dashes instead of BEM notation) to match the existing HTML structure.
- **Updated Color Functions**: Replaced `color.channel()` with `color.red()`, `color.green()`, and `color.blue()` for better compatibility with the current SASS setup.
- **Successfully Compiled**: All SASS files now compile correctly with the original styling intact.

### July 9, 2023

- **Complete Reversion**: After careful consideration, most Phase 2 changes were reverted to restore critical styling features.
- **Decision Point**: Determined that a more incremental approach is needed for the SASS Variable Standardization project to ensure visual consistency.

## Updated Approach

Instead of a complete overhaul, a step-by-step approach will be taken:

1. Document all current styling patterns and effects thoroughly
2. Create a migration plan for each component that preserves its unique styling
3. Test each component individually before committing changes
4. Focus on maintaining backward compatibility throughout the process

## Key Learnings

- **Timing of Standardization**: We need to carefully consider the timing of standardization efforts to minimize disruption to the development workflow.

- **Balancing Consistency and Aesthetics**: Some components have unique styling needs that work better with their original implementation. A hybrid approach allows us to maintain the desired aesthetic while improving the overall system.

- **User Preferences**: User feedback is critical in determining whether a component should use the token system or maintain its original styling.

- **Incremental Implementation**: Taking a more incremental approach to applying the token system is more effective than attempting to update multiple components simultaneously.

- **Thorough Testing**: Comprehensive testing is essential before implementing changes across components to avoid compilation errors and other issues.
