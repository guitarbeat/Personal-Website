## Implementation Strategy

We are reassessing our approach to implementing the SASS variable standardization:

1. **Incremental Implementation**: Take a more gradual approach to implementing the token system.
2. **Thorough Testing**: Ensure comprehensive testing before applying changes to components.
3. **User Experience Focus**: Prioritize maintaining a consistent user experience during the transition.
4. **Selective Updates**: Carefully evaluate which components should be updated and in what order.
5. **Documentation First**: Update documentation before making code changes to ensure clarity.
6. **Single Source of Truth**: Consolidate all design tokens into a single location.
7. **Consistent Naming**: Apply consistent naming conventions across all variables.

- Remove unused variables
- Consolidate duplicated definitions
- Standardize naming conventions
- Improve documentation

### SASS Codebase Analysis

- **Issue**: Analyzed SASS codebase for variable duplication

- **Impact**: Provides clear targets for SASS architecture improvements

### ESLint Warnings in ToolsSection.js

- **Issue**: ESLint identified unused variables and components
- **Fix**: Removed unused variants and components, made isUnlocked usage more explicit
- **Impact**: Improved code maintainability and reduced bundle size

## Implementation Strategy

### SASS Variable Standardization

1. **Incremental Implementation**: Make changes incrementally to maintain backward compatibility
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Test each change to ensure styles render correctly
3. **Focus on User Experience**: Prioritize changes that improve user experience
4. **Selective Updates**: Only update variables that are clearly duplicated or unused
5. **Documentation First**: Document the design token system before making changes
6. **Single Source of Truth**: Maintain `_tokens.scss` as the authoritative source for all design tokens
7. **Consistent Naming**: Apply consistent naming conventions to all variables

## SASS Architecture Lessons Learned

Our work on the SASS architecture has provided several valuable insights:

1. **Module Imports**: Always include necessary SASS module imports (`@use "sass:map"`, etc.) in files that use module-specific functions
2. **Incremental Updates**: Implement and test changes incrementally rather than attempting a large-scale refactoring
3. **Clear Deprecation Path**: Provide clear guidance and warnings for deprecated patterns
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Test compilation after each major change to identify issues early
5. **Documentation First**: Update documentation before making code changes to ensure clarity
6. **Component-First Migration**: Start with one component as a proof of concept before broader implementation
7. **User Experience Focus**: Prioritize maintaining user experience during architectural changes

We've successfully completed Phase 1 (Consolidation) and are halfway through Phase 2 (Converting Forwarding to Utilities), with early progress on Phase 3 (Component Migration). The improvements have already enhanced maintainability while ensuring backward compatibility with existing code.
