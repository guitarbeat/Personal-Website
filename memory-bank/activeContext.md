# Active Context: Personal Website

## Current Focus
The current focus is on improving the SASS architecture integration between the Tools section and the main site's SASS structure. This includes fixing SASS deprecation warnings, standardizing breakpoint usage, ensuring proper namespacing for imports, and conducting a comprehensive audit of all SASS variables to identify standardization opportunities.

## Active Decisions

### SASS Architecture
- **Decision**: Use a modified 7-1 SASS architecture pattern
- **Status**: Implemented
- **Context**: Provides a clear structure for organizing styles, makes maintenance easier, and promotes reusability

### Styling System
- **Decision**: Use CSS custom properties for theme values
- **Status**: Partially implemented
- **Context**: Allows for dynamic theme changes without page reload, reduces CSS duplication

### Breakpoint System
- **Decision**: Use a standardized breakpoint system with mixins
- **Status**: Implemented
- **Context**: Ensures consistent responsive behavior across the site

### SASS Deprecation Warnings
- **Decision**: Address all SASS deprecation warnings
- **Status**: Completed
- **Context**: Prepares the codebase for future SASS versions, improves code quality

### Mixin Consolidation
- **Decision**: Consolidate duplicate mixins to shared styles
- **Status**: Implemented
- **Context**: Reduces code duplication, improves maintainability, and ensures consistent styling

### Variable Standardization
- **Decision**: Implement a design token system based on audit findings
- **Status**: Planning
- **Context**: Will improve consistency, maintainability, and scalability of the design system

### Accessibility
- **Decision**: Implement comprehensive accessibility features
- **Status**: In progress
- **Context**: Ensures the site is usable by all users, including those with disabilities

## Open Questions

### SASS Variable Standardization
- What is the best approach to implement the design token system?
- Should we create a new `_tokens.scss` file or refactor existing files?
- How should we handle the transition from current variables to the new system?

### Scrollbar Styling
- Should we implement custom scrollbar styling for the Tools section?
- How can we ensure it's consistent with the main site's scrollbar styling?

### Mobile Interaction
- How can we improve the EmotionWheel interaction on mobile devices?
- Should we implement haptic feedback for mobile interactions?

### SASS Architecture
- Should we move all keyframes to dedicated files?
- How can we ensure consistent naming conventions across all SASS files?

### Performance
- How can we optimize animations for better performance on mobile devices?
- Should we implement code splitting for the Tools section?

## SASS Integration Issues

### Inconsistent Variable Usage
- **Status**: Partially addressed, audit completed
- **Context**: Some components use hardcoded values instead of global variables
- **Solution**: Replace hardcoded values with global variables based on audit findings

### Separate Styling Approaches
- **Status**: In progress
- **Context**: Tools section has its own parallel styling structure
- **Solution**: Integrate Tools styles with main SASS architecture

### Limited Variable Sharing
- **Status**: In progress, audit completed
- **Context**: Not consistently using global variables
- **Solution**: Use global variables and mixins where available, implement design token system

### Duplicate Patterns
- **Status**: Addressed
- **Context**: Redefining mixins that exist in main architecture
- **Solution**: Consolidated duplicate mixins to shared styles

### Inconsistent Theming
- **Status**: In progress
- **Context**: Different approaches to light/dark mode
- **Solution**: Implement consistent theme handling

### Performance Issues
- **Status**: In progress
- **Context**: Some animations and transitions are not optimized
- **Solution**: Optimize animations and transitions for better performance
