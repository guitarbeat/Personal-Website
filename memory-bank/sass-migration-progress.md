# SASS Migration Progress

## Current Status

- **Phase**: Phase 2 (Variable Cleanup)
- **Last Updated**: 2024-03-18
- **Status**: Fixed compilation errors, continuing cleanup

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Initial variable analysis
- [x] Created migration plan
- [x] Identified unused variables
- [x] Documented current state
- [x] Created variable organization structure
- [x] Phase 1: Variable Consolidation
  - [x] Consolidated breakpoint variables in `_tokens.scss`
  - [x] Consolidated transition variables in `_tokens.scss`
  - [x] Consolidated z-index variables in `_tokens.scss`
  - [x] Removed redundant imports and definitions
  - [x] Deleted original `_breakpoints.scss`
- [x] Phase 2: Variable Cleanup (Part 1)
  - [x] Removed deprecated variables from `_variables.scss`
  - [x] Updated CSS custom properties to use tokens
  - [x] Added proper JavaScript exports
  - [x] Fixed linting issues
  - [x] Fixed compilation errors
    - [x] Added missing sass:map import
    - [x] Fixed z-index reference in variables
    - [x] Created new `_breakpoints.scss` for compatibility
    - [x] Updated imports in `_base.scss`

## Next Steps

1. Continue Phase 2: Variable Cleanup
   - [ ] Clean up theme variables in `_base.scss`
   - [ ] Review and update design system variables
   - [ ] Remove unused shadow variables

## Issues and Decisions

### Open Issues

1. Need to verify if some "unused" variables are false positives
2. Need to determine if any variables are used in JavaScript files
3. Need to verify impact on build process

### Decisions Made

1. Using `_tokens.scss` as single source of truth for design tokens
2. Adopting SASS modules pattern
3. Moving to a more structured file organization
4. Created new `_breakpoints.scss` to maintain backward compatibility
5. Added proper JavaScript exports in `_variables.scss` for theme colors and breakpoints
6. Updated CSS custom properties to use token functions
7. Fixed SASS compilation errors by improving imports and references

## Variables to Watch

Variables that need special attention during migration:

### Duplicates Consolidated

```scss
// Breakpoints consolidated in _tokens.scss
$breakpoints: (
  'largest': $bp-largest,   // 1200px
  'large': $bp-large,       // 1000px
  'medium': $bp-medium,     // 800px
  'small': $bp-small,       // 600px
  'smallest': $bp-smallest  // 500px
);

// Transitions already well-structured in _tokens.scss
$transitions: (
  'duration': (...),
  'timing': (...)
);

// Z-index already well-structured in _tokens.scss
$z-index: (
  'base': 1,
  'tooltip': 10,
  ...
);
```

### Potentially Unused (Verify Before Removing)

```scss
// Design System
$component-shadows
$component-spacing
$semantic-spacing
$semantic-type-scale

// Legacy
$shadow-light
$shadow-medium
$theme-transition-properties
$transition-duration-long

// Animations
$bounce-out
$smooth-out

// Theme Variables
$track-padding
$spacing-ratio
```

## Audit Log

### 2024-03-18

- Created migration plan
- Identified 34 potentially unused variables
- Documented current variable organization
- Created progress tracking system
- Completed Phase 1: Variable Consolidation
  - Consolidated breakpoint variables
  - Consolidated transition variables
  - Consolidated z-index variables
  - Removed redundant definitions
  - Deleted original `_breakpoints.scss`
- Started Phase 2: Variable Cleanup
  - Removed deprecated variables from `_variables.scss`
  - Updated CSS custom properties to use tokens
  - Added proper JavaScript exports
  - Fixed linting issues
  - Fixed compilation errors
    - Added missing sass:map import
    - Fixed z-index reference in variables
    - Created new `_breakpoints.scss` for compatibility
    - Updated imports in `_base.scss`

## Notes

- Keep this file updated as migration progresses
- Document any issues or roadblocks encountered
- Track any decisions made during implementation
- Note any variables that require special handling
- Some JavaScript exports were commented out during consolidation - need to review impact
- Added proper JavaScript exports for theme colors and breakpoints
- Created new `_breakpoints.scss` to maintain backward compatibility while transitioning to tokens
