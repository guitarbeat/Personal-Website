## Implementation Plan for Variable Standardization

### Phase 1: Consolidation (Weeks 1-2) - IN PROGRESS
- âœ… Create a new `_tokens.scss` file to serve as the single source of truth
- âœ… Consolidate all theme colors into this file
- âœ… Unify the breakpoint system
- âœ… Standardize transitions and animations
- âœ… Update core SASS files to use tokens
- âœ… Update theme files to use tokens
- ðŸ”„ Update component styles to use tokens where appropriate
- â¬œ Test the new token system to ensure it works correctly

### Phase 2: Standardization (Weeks 3-4)
