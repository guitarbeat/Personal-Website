### July 9, 2023

- Removed Phase 2 SASS token system due to compatibility issues
- Decided to take a more incremental approach to code improvements
- Backtracked to ensure critical visual elements remain intact

## Implementation Strategy

We are reassessing our approach to implementing the SASS variable standardization:

1. **Incremental Implementation**: Take a more gradual approach to implementing the token system.
2. **Thorough Testing**: Ensure comprehensive testing before applying changes to components.
3. **User Experience Focus**: Prioritize maintaining a consistent user experience during the transition.
4. **Selective Updates**: Carefully evaluate which components should be updated and in what order.
5. **Documentation First**: Update documentation before making code changes to ensure clarity.
6. **Single Source of Truth**: Consolidate all design tokens into a single location.
7. **Consistent Naming**: Apply consistent naming conventions across all variables.
