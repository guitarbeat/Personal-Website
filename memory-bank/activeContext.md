## Current Focus

Working on SASS architecture improvements and fixing mixed declarations in component styles. Addressing theme system enhancements and responsive design patterns.

## Recent Changes

- **2024-03-21**: Fixed mixed declarations in `conflict-mediation.scss`
- **2024-03-21**: Updated breakpoint usage from `bp.respond` to `mix.respond`
- **2024-03-21**: Standardized glass-effect implementation across components
- **2024-03-21**: Updated color function usage to modern syntax

## Next Steps

1. Review and update remaining mixed declarations in SCSS files
2. Standardize responsive breakpoint implementation across all components
3. Enhance glass-morphism effect consistency
4. Optimize theme transition performance
5. Document updated SASS patterns and best practices
