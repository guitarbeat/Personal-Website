# Project Brief: SASS Variable Standardization Phase 2

## Purpose
Phase 2 of the SASS Variable Standardization project aims to build upon the foundation established in Phase 1 by creating specialized systems for spacing, typography, and shadows, implementing a more robust responsive design system, and enhancing the animation and transition system. This will further improve the consistency, maintainability, and scalability of the design system for the personal website.

## Core Requirements

### Enhanced Spacing System
- Create a more structured spacing scale with clear relationships between sizes
- Implement spacing utilities for margin and padding
- Define spacing tokens for specific UI patterns (form fields, cards, etc.)
- Create a responsive spacing system that adjusts based on viewport size

### Comprehensive Typography System
- Develop a comprehensive type scale with clear hierarchical relationships
- Define typography roles (heading, body, caption, etc.) with associated styles
- Create responsive typography that scales based on viewport size
- Implement a vertical rhythm system for consistent spacing between text elements
- Define line-height and letter-spacing values for different text styles

### Shadow System
- Create a consistent elevation system with corresponding shadows
- Define shadow tokens for different UI states (hover, active, etc.)
- Implement a system for both dark and light themes
- Create utility classes for applying shadows

### Responsive Design System
- Enhance the breakpoint system with more contextual breakpoints
- Create mixins for common responsive patterns
- Implement a container query approach for component-level responsiveness
- Define a standard approach for responsive images and media

### Animation and Transition System
- Create a comprehensive animation library for common UI interactions
- Define standard durations and easing functions for different types of animations
- Implement a system for managing animation complexity based on user preferences
- Create utility classes for common animations

### Documentation
- Create comprehensive documentation for all new systems
- Provide examples and usage guidelines
- Document best practices for implementation

## Success Criteria
- All new systems are implemented and documented
- Component styles are updated to use the new systems
- No hardcoded values for spacing, typography, or shadows in the codebase
- Improved visual consistency across all components
- Enhanced developer experience with clear guidelines and utilities
- Improved performance and accessibility scores

## Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing components
- Must support all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Must be accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- Must be performant on mobile devices
- Must support dark and light themes

## Stakeholders
- **Developer**: Responsible for implementing the design system
- **Designer**: Provides input on visual design and user experience
- **End Users**: Benefit from improved visual consistency and user experience
- **Future Maintainers**: Benefit from improved code quality and documentation

## Timeline
- **Week 1**: Audit current usage and create detailed specifications
- **Week 2**: Implement enhanced spacing and typography systems
- **Week 3**: Implement shadow and responsive design systems
- **Week 4**: Implement animation system and update component styles
- **Week 5**: Create documentation and finalize implementation

## Deliverables
- Updated `_tokens.scss` file with new systems
- New mixins and functions for accessing and applying tokens
- Updated component styles using the new systems
- Comprehensive documentation for all systems
- Examples and usage guidelines

- `src/sass/_tokens.scss`: Main token definitions
- `src/sass/_mixins.scss`: Reusable style patterns
- `src/sass/_breakpoints.scss`: Responsive design utilities
