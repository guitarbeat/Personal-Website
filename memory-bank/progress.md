## Recent Updates

### July 10, 2023

- **Theme-Aware Text Shadow Implementation**:
  - Added new CSS variable `--text-shadow` for theme-specific text shadows
  - Light mode: Implemented white glow effect for better contrast
  - Dark mode: Maintained original dark shadow for depth
  - Applied to all header text elements (h1, h2, h3)
  - Enhanced visibility and aesthetics across both themes
- **Hover State Improvements**:
  - Improved contrast for hover states
  - Dark mode: Brighter colors on hover for better visibility
  - Light mode: Darker colors on hover for stronger contrast
  - Enhanced interactive feedback across themes
- **Color Palette Refinements**:
  - Restored original blackish dark mode
  - Maintained light greyish light mode
  - Enhanced blue-toned sage palette
  - Preserved original coral/sand colors with improved contrast
- Fixed avatar flickering in Header component by using proper theme variables
- Restored enhanced About section with glass blur effects and improved animations
- Fixed navbar z-index to appear above the vignette blur effect
- Added color-inverting border to the navbar
- Reverted changes to the About component to restore original styling
- Restored vignette blur effect with proper class naming and mixins
- Updated color functions for better compatibility (replaced color.channel with color.red/green/blue)
- Successfully compiled SASS with all original visual effects

### July 9, 2023

- Removed Phase 2 SASS token system due to compatibility issues
- Decided to take a more incremental approach to code improvements
- Backtracked to ensure critical visual elements remain intact

## Implementation Strategy

We are reassessing our approach to implementing the SASS variable standardization:

1. **Incremental Implementation**: Take a more gradual approach to implementing the token system.
2. **Thorough Testing**: Ensure comprehensive testing before applying changes to components.
3. **User Experience Focus**: Prioritize maintaining a consistent user experience during the transition.
4. **Selective Updates**: Carefully evaluate which components should be updated and in what order.
