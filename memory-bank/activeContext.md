# Active Context: Personal Website

## Current Focus
The current focus is on improving component naming to better reflect functionality, specifically renaming the "Meditation" component to "ConflictMediation" since the tool is actually designed for conflict resolution rather than meditation.

## Recent Changes
- **Component Renaming** (Current Date): Renamed the Meditation component to ConflictMediation to better reflect its purpose
  - Updated the component file name from `Meditation.js` to `ConflictMediation.js`
  - Updated the SCSS file name from `meditation.scss` to `conflictMediation.scss`
  - Modified import statements in App.js to reference the new component name
  - Updated the route path from `/meditation` to `/conflict-mediation`
  - Changed localStorage keys from 'meditationForm' to 'conflictMediationForm'
  - Updated CSS class names from 'meditation-container' to 'conflict-mediation-container'
  - Changed the component title from "Self-Reflection Tool" to "Conflict Resolution Tool"

## Next Steps
1. Review other components for potential naming improvements
2. Consider updating the ConflictMediation tool's UI to better match its conflict resolution purpose
3. Ensure the tool is properly integrated with the rest of the website
4. Add the ConflictMediation tool to the Tools section if not already included
5. Test the renamed component thoroughly to ensure all functionality works as expected

## Active Decisions
- **Component Naming Convention**: Components should be named according to their actual functionality rather than legacy or placeholder names
- **Route Naming**: URL routes should match component names using kebab-case (e.g., `/conflict-mediation`)
- **CSS Class Naming**: CSS classes should follow the same naming convention as their components

## Open Questions
- Should other tools be reviewed for similar naming issues?
- Is the current UI of the ConflictMediation tool appropriate for its purpose?
- Are there any other references to "meditation" in the codebase that need to be updated?
- Should the tool's functionality be expanded to better serve conflict resolution purposes?
