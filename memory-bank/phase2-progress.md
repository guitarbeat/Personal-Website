# Phase 2 Progress: SASS Variable Standardization

## Overview

This document tracks the progress of Phase 2 of the SASS Variable Standardization project, which focuses on creating enhanced systems for spacing, typography, and shadows, as well as updating components to use these new systems.

## Current Status

**Status**: Implementation  
**Expected completion**: 2023-08-01

## Completed Tasks

### Foundation Systems

- ✅ Created enhanced systems for spacing, typography, and shadows in `_tokens.scss`
- ✅ Implemented function and mixin libraries for each system
- ✅ Created comprehensive utility classes for spacing, typography, and shadows
- ✅ Added CSS variables for shadows to enable theme switching

### Documentation

- ✅ Completed spacing system specification
- ✅ Completed typography system specification
- ✅ Completed shadow system specification
- ✅ Created animation system specification
- ✅ Created component update plan
- ✅ Created style guide template

### Component Updates

- ✅ Header Component (Updated to use new token system)

### Bug Fixes

- ✅ Fixed SASS compilation error by adding missing `line-height()` function
- ✅ Fixed dependency issues by adding yocto-queue package
- ✅ Fixed Markdown linting issues in documentation
- ✅ Consolidated typography files for better organization
- ✅ Fixed SASS deprecation warnings in ConflictMediation component
- ✅ Fixed undefined mixin errors by adding proper imports

## In Progress

- ⬜ Updating NavBar component to use the new token system
- ⬜ Updating About component to use the new token system
- ⬜ Implementing the animation system based on the specification
- ⬜ Creating comprehensive user-facing documentation

## Next Steps

### Week 3: Shadow and Responsive Systems

- ⬜ Enhance breakpoint system with contextual breakpoints
- ⬜ Develop mixins for common responsive patterns
- ⬜ Create container query approach for component-level responsiveness
- ⬜ Update documentation for shadow and responsive systems

### Week 4: Animation System and Component Updates

- ⬜ Create comprehensive animation library
- ⬜ Define standard durations and easing functions
- ⬜ Implement system for managing animation complexity
- ⬜ Create animation utility classes
- ⬜ Continue updating component styles to use new systems
- ⬜ Update documentation for animation system

### Week 5: Finalization and Documentation

- ⬜ Complete component style updates
- ⬜ Create comprehensive documentation for all systems
- ⬜ Develop examples and usage guidelines
- ⬜ Conduct testing and gather feedback
- ⬜ Make final adjustments based on feedback
- ⬜ Finalize implementation and documentation

## Implementation Strategy

For the remaining work, we will follow this strategy:

1. **Component Updates**: Start with the most frequently used components and those with the most inconsistent styling. Update them incrementally to minimize disruption.

2. **Documentation**: Create documentation alongside component updates to ensure accurate and up-to-date information.

3. **Responsive Enhancements**: Implement these after component updates to ensure they address actual needs identified during the update process.

4. **Animation System**: Implement this last, as it builds upon the other systems and requires them to be stable.

## Success Metrics

- Reduction in hardcoded values
- Consistent spacing across components
- Improved responsive behavior
- Simplified component styles
- Easier maintenance and updates
