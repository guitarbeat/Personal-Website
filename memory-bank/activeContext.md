# Active Context: Personal Website

## Current Focus

The current focus is on improving component naming to better reflect functionality and ensuring consistent code style throughout the codebase.

## Recent Changes

- **Component Renaming** (Current Date): Renamed the Meditation component to ConflictMediation to better reflect its purpose
  - Updated the component file name from `Meditation.js` to `ConflictMediation.js`
  - Updated the SCSS file name from `meditation.scss` to `conflictMediation.scss`
  - Modified import statements in App.js to reference the new component name
  - Updated the route path from `/meditation` to `/conflict-mediation`
  - Changed localStorage keys from 'meditationForm' to 'conflictMediationForm'
  - Updated CSS class names from 'meditation-container' to 'conflict-mediation-container'
  - Changed the component title from "Self-Reflection Tool" to "Conflict Resolution Tool"

- **Code Style Improvements** (Current Date): Added block braces to all if statements in ConflictMediation.js
  - Fixed Sourcery linting warnings about missing block braces
  - Improved code consistency and readability
  - Reduced potential for bugs in future code modifications

## Next Steps

1. Review other components for potential naming improvements
2. Continue addressing code style issues flagged by linters
3. Consider updating the ConflictMediation tool's UI to better match its conflict resolution purpose
4. Ensure the tool is properly integrated with the rest of the website
5. Add the ConflictMediation tool to the Tools section if not already included
6. Test the renamed component thoroughly to ensure all functionality works as expected

## Active Decisions

- **Component Naming Convention**: Components should be named according to their actual functionality rather than legacy or placeholder names
- **Route Naming**: URL routes should match component names using kebab-case (e.g., `/conflict-mediation`)
- **CSS Class Naming**: CSS classes should follow the same naming convention as their components
- **Code Style**: All conditional statements should use block braces, even for single-line returns

## Open Questions

- Should other tools be reviewed for similar naming issues?
- Are there other code style inconsistencies that should be addressed?
- Is the current UI of the ConflictMediation tool appropriate for its purpose?
- Are there any other references to "meditation" in the codebase that need to be updated?
- Should the tool's functionality be expanded to better serve conflict resolution purposes?
