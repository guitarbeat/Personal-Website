## Recent Fixes

### SASS Architecture Improvements
- Fixed SASS compilation errors in various components
- Addressed deprecation warnings by wrapping declarations after nested rules in `& {}`
- Removed `&` selectors from keyframes
- Added proper namespacing to SASS imports
- Improved integration between Tools styles and main SASS architecture
- Consolidated duplicate mixins from Tools styles to shared styles
- Created reusable fullscreen mixins for better maintainability
- Moved keyframes to shared styles for consistency
- Completed comprehensive audit of all SASS variables

### Mobile Responsiveness
- Added mobile breakpoint (480px) to breakpoints map
- Updated responsive styles to use the new breakpoint
- Improved layout adjustments for small screens

### Code Quality
- Replaced hardcoded values with global variables
- Improved component scoping
- Enhanced readability with better organization
- Added comments for complex sections
- Reduced code duplication by consolidating mixins
- Improved maintainability by centralizing shared styles
- Documented all SASS variables and identified standardization opportunities

## File Updates
The following files have been updated to fix SASS deprecation warnings and improve architecture:

1. `src/sass/_breakpoints.scss` - Added mobile breakpoint (480px)
2. `src/components/Tools/shared/styles/index.scss` - Added proper imports, updated breakpoint usage, and consolidated mixins
3. `src/components/Tools/styles/index.scss` - Fixed keyframes, wrapped declarations, and removed duplicate mixins
4. `src/sass/theme/_theme-switch.scss` - Fixed keyframes and wrapped declarations
5. `src/sass/_base.scss` - Ensured proper nesting and declarations
6. `src/components/content/Header/text.scss` - Added proper namespacing for imports
7. `memory-bank/sass-variables-audit.md` - Created comprehensive audit of all SASS variables

## Next Steps
1. Complete the integration of Tools styles with main SASS architecture
2. Implement SASS variable standardization based on audit findings:
   - Consolidate theme colors into a single source of truth
   - Create a comprehensive spacing system
   - Develop a typography system with clear roles
   - Unify the breakpoint system
   - Standardize transitions and animations
   - Create a comprehensive shadow system
3. Enhance mobile responsiveness for all tools
4. Implement performance optimizations
5. Improve accessibility features
6. Add animation transitions between states

## Implementation Plan for Variable Standardization

### Phase 1: Consolidation (Weeks 1-2)
- Create a new `_tokens.scss` file to serve as the single source of truth
- Consolidate all theme colors into this file
- Unify the breakpoint system
- Standardize transitions and animations

### Phase 2: Standardization (Weeks 3-4)
- Create a comprehensive spacing system
- Develop a typography system with clear roles
- Implement a shadow system with consistent elevations

### Phase 3: Implementation (Weeks 5-6)
- Update all components to use the standardized variables
- Create documentation for the new variable system
- Implement linting rules to enforce usage of variables

### Phase 4: Refinement (Weeks 7-8)
- Test the new system across all components
- Gather feedback and make adjustments
- Finalize documentation and best practices
