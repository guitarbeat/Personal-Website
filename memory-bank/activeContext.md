## Open Questions

### SASS Variable Standardization
- How should we handle the transition from legacy variables to tokens?
- Should we create a migration guide for developers?
- How can we ensure all components are updated to use the new token system?

### Component-Specific Variables
- Should component-specific variables be defined in the tokens file or in component files?
- How can we ensure component-specific variables follow the same naming conventions?

### Scrollbar Styling
- Should we implement custom scrollbar styling for the Tools section?
- How can we ensure it's consistent with the main site's scrollbar styling?

### Mobile Interaction
- How can we improve the EmotionWheel interaction on mobile devices?
- Should we implement haptic feedback for mobile interactions?

### SASS Architecture
- Should we move all keyframes to dedicated files?
- How can we ensure consistent naming conventions across all SASS files?

### Performance
- How can we optimize animations for better performance on mobile devices?
- Should we implement code splitting for the Tools section?

## SASS Integration Issues

### Inconsistent Variable Usage

- **Solution**: Integrate Tools styles with main SASS architecture

### Limited Variable Sharing
- **Status**: In progress, Phase 1 in progress
- **Context**: Not consistently using global variables
- **Solution**: Use tokens and CSS custom properties where available

### Duplicate Patterns
- **Status**: Addressed
- **Context**: Redefining mixins that exist in main architecture
- **Solution**: Consolidated duplicate mixins to shared styles

### Inconsistent Theming
- **Status**: In progress
- **Context**: Different approaches to light/dark mode
- **Solution**: Implement consistent theme handling using tokens

### Performance Issues
- **Status**: In progress
- **Context**: Some animations and transitions are not optimized
- **Solution**: Optimize animations and transitions for better performance
