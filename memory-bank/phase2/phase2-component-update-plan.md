# Component Update Plan for Phase 2

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for updating components to use the new token system implemented in Phase 2 of the SASS Variable Standardization project. The goal is to systematically update components to use the new spacing, typography, and shadow systems to ensure consistency across the website.

## Prioritization Criteria

Components will be prioritized based on:

1. **Visibility**: Components that appear on multiple pages or are prominently displayed
2. **Complexity**: Components with complex styling that would benefit most from standardization
3. **Inconsistency**: Components with inconsistent styling or hardcoded values
4. **Reusability**: Components that are reused throughout the application

## Component Priority List

### High Priority (Week 1)

1. **Header Component** *(Priority #1)*
   - High visibility across all pages
   - Contains typography that should use the new type scale
   - Likely has spacing inconsistencies

2. **NavBar Component** *(Priority #2)*
   - High visibility across all pages
   - Contains interactive elements that could benefit from shadow system
   - Responsive behavior needs standardization

3. **About Component** *(Priority #3)*
   - Key content component with various typography elements
   - Contains cards and sections that could use component-specific spacing

### Medium Priority (Week 2)

1. **Projects Component** *(Priority #4)*
   - Contains project cards that could benefit from standardized spacing and shadows
   - Typography hierarchy needs consistency

2. **Work Component** *(Priority #5)*
   - Contains timeline elements that need consistent spacing
   - Typography hierarchy needs standardization

3. **Tool Components (Conflict Mediation, Bingo, Snake)** *(Priority #6)*
   - Interactive components that could benefit from shadow system
   - Contains forms and interactive elements with spacing inconsistencies

### Lower Priority (Week 3)

1. **Effects Components** *(Priority #7)*
   - Visual effects that might need special consideration
   - Less critical for user experience

2. **Core Components** *(Priority #8)*
   - Foundational components that might require careful updates
   - Changes here affect multiple other components

## Update Process for Each Component

### 1. Analysis Phase

- Review current component styles
- Identify hardcoded values and inconsistencies
- Map current values to new token system

### 2. Implementation Phase

- Update spacing values to use spacing functions and mixins
- Update typography to use typography functions and mixins
- Update shadows to use shadow functions and mixins
- Replace utility classes with new standardized utilities

### 3. Testing Phase

- Verify visual appearance matches design
- Test responsive behavior
- Ensure no regression in functionality

### 4. Documentation Phase

- Document component-specific tokens
- Update component documentation with usage examples
- Note any special considerations or exceptions

## Implementation Guidelines

### Spacing Updates

- Replace hardcoded padding/margin values with `spacing()` function
- Use component-specific spacing tokens where appropriate
- Implement responsive spacing using breakpoint mixins

### Typography Updates

- Replace hardcoded font sizes with `type-scale()` function
- Use semantic type tokens for consistent hierarchy
- Implement heading and text mixins for consistent styling
- Consider fluid typography for responsive text

### Shadow Updates

- Replace hardcoded box-shadow values with shadow mixins
- Use elevation system for consistent depth
- Implement interactive shadows for hover/active states

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: High priority components
- **Week 2**: Medium priority components
- **Week 3**: Lower priority components
- **Week 4**: Final testing and refinement

## Success Metrics

- Reduction in hardcoded values
- Consistent spacing across components
- Improved responsive behavior
- Simplified component styles
- Easier maintenance and updates
