# Active Context: Personal Website Tools

## Current Focus
Improving SASS architecture integration between the Tools section and the main site's SASS structure, with a focus on fixing bug-prone patterns and deprecated approaches.

## Recent Changes
- Fixed SASS compilation errors in ConflictMediation styles
- Fixed non-functional tools in ConflictMediation.js:
  - Fixed EmotionAxes component to handle emotionAxes object properly
  - Updated ReflectionPrompts to handle different emotion formats
  - Added proper state handling for emotionAxesValues
- Improved contrast in tool selector for light mode
- Integrated Tools styles with main SASS architecture:
  - Updated import statements to use global SASS files
  - Replaced hardcoded values with global variables
  - Leveraged existing mixins instead of redefining them
  - Updated transition timing and durations to use global variables
- Fixed SASS compilation errors in ToolsSection styles:
  - Updated bp.respond to mix.respond to use the correct mixin
  - Removed incorrect @forward directive in index.scss
  - Fixed import structure to properly handle the breakpoints module
- Improved SASS code quality and performance:
  - Replaced `transition: all` with specific property transitions
  - Added missing CSS variable definitions for Bingo component
  - Updated Snake component to use SASS architecture properly
  - Replaced hardcoded media queries with mixins
  - Optimized will-change usage
  - Added comprehensive reduced motion support for accessibility
- Fixed critical SASS compilation errors in Bingo component:
  - Fixed order of @use statements in index.scss
  - Added missing SASS architecture imports in bingo.scss
  - Replaced remaining hardcoded media queries with mixins
  - Replaced remaining `transition: all` with specific properties

## Next Steps
1. Continue SASS integration improvements:
   - Update remaining tool components to use global variables
   - Standardize CSS variable usage across all tools
   - Implement consistent theme handling for light/dark modes
   - Refactor remaining component styles to use shared patterns
2. Enhance mobile responsiveness:
   - Improve EmotionWheel mobile interaction
   - Optimize NeedsAssessment layout for small screens
   - Add touch-friendly controls
3. Add animation transitions between steps
4. Implement performance optimizations:
   - Optimize remaining will-change usage
   - Implement code splitting for tools

## Active Decisions
- SASS Architecture: Using modern @use syntax with proper namespacing
- Styling System: Leveraging global mixins and variables for consistency
- Component Scoping: Keeping component styles properly scoped
- State Management: Using localStorage for persistence
- Mobile Design: Implementing stacked layout for smaller screens
- Theme Integration: Aligning Tools section with main site's theming system
- Mixin Usage: Using mix.respond instead of bp.respond for breakpoint handling
- Performance: Specifying exact properties in transitions instead of using `all`
- Accessibility: Added reduced motion support for animations
- SASS Import Order: Ensuring @use statements come before any CSS rules

## Open Questions
- Should we create a separate mixin for scrollbar styling?
- How can we improve the emotion wheel's mobile interaction?
- Should we implement a dark mode variant of the glass effect?
- Would adding haptic feedback improve mobile interaction?
- Should we add a progress autosave indicator?
- Should we consolidate all breakpoint handling to use a single approach?
- Should we create a central animation system with consistent timing functions?

## SASS Integration Issues
1. **Inconsistent Variable Usage**: ✅ Partially addressed
   - Replaced hardcoded transition values with global variables
   - Still need to replace more hardcoded colors and values

2. **Separate Styling Approach**: ✅ Partially addressed
   - Updated import statements to use global SASS files
   - Still need to update more components

3. **Inconsistent Light/Dark Mode Handling**: ⏳ In progress
   - Improved contrast in tool selector for light mode
   - Need to implement consistent theme handling

4. **Redundant Style Definitions**: ✅ Partially addressed
   - Leveraged existing mixins for common patterns
   - Still need to replace more redundant definitions

5. **Lack of Integration with Global Theme Variables**: ⏳ In progress
   - Started using global variables
   - Need to standardize CSS variable usage

6. **Inconsistent Breakpoint Handling**: ✅ Addressed
   - Updated bp.respond to mix.respond for consistent breakpoint handling
   - Removed incorrect @forward directive in index.scss
   - Replaced hardcoded media queries with mixins

7. **Performance Issues**: ✅ Addressed
   - Replaced `transition: all` with specific property transitions
   - Optimized will-change usage
   - Added reduced motion support for accessibility

8. **SASS Import Order Issues**: ✅ Addressed
   - Fixed order of @use statements in Bingo component
   - Ensured all @use statements come before any CSS rules
