## Implementation Strategy

We are using a balanced approach to implementing the SASS variable standardization:

1. **Selective Implementation**: Apply the token system selectively based on component requirements and user aesthetic preferences.
2. **Component Audit**: Carefully evaluate each component to determine if it should use tokens or maintain original styling.
3. **User Feedback Integration**: Incorporate user feedback to refine styling decisions.
