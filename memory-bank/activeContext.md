## Current Focus (Updated 2025-03-17)

We are actively implementing component updates for Phase 2 of the SASS Variable Standardization project. We have completed the About component update and are now focusing on finishing the animation utility classes and updating the Portfolio component. We've also reverted the Header component to its original styling based on user preference.

## Immediate Tasks in Progress

1. **About Component Update** (✅ 100% complete, March 17, 2025)
   - Implemented responsive typography for component text elements
   - Updated spacing tokens and shadow implementation
   - Replaced hardcoded values with tokens
   - Improved responsive behavior using breakpoint mixins
   - Tested across all breakpoints

2. **Header Component Reversion** (✅ 100% complete, March 17, 2025)
   - Reverted to original styling as per user preference
   - Removed token system implementation
   - Restored original fixed font sizes and spacing
   - Restored original media query implementation

3. **Animation Utility Classes** (50% complete, ETA: 2025-03-25)
   - Base animation system foundation is complete
   - Currently implementing fade animations for UI elements
   - Still need to implement slide, scale, and transform animations
   - Performance testing needed once implementation is complete

4. **Portfolio Component Update** (30% complete, ETA: 2025-03-30)
   - Started audit of hardcoded values
   - Main card structure needs update to token system
   - Project filtering functionality remains to be tested with new styles

## Current Decisions Being Made

1. **Component-by-Component Approach** (Decision made: 2025-03-17)
   - Allowing for component-specific styling preferences
   - Some components (like Header) will maintain their original styling
   - Other components will use the new token system
   - This hybrid approach allows for maintaining preferred aesthetics while improving system overall

2. **Animation Performance Strategy** (Decision needed by: 2025-03-20)
   - Evaluating whether to use CSS animations or JS-based animations for complex interactions
   - Considering performance impact on mobile devices
   - Testing different approaches to find optimal solution
   - **Next step**: Complete benchmark tests and make final decision

3. **Component Update Priority** (Decision made: 2025-03-17)
   - Have decided to complete all major visible components first (Portfolio, Work) before moving to less visible components
   - This approach provides a more cohesive user experience during the transition
   - **Next step**: Update Portfolio component followed by Work component

4. **Documentation Format** (Decision in progress)
   - Evaluating options for documentation format (internal docs vs. style guide site)
   - Considering integration with existing documentation
   - **Next step**: Create prototype of documentation format options

## Latest Changes (Last 24 Hours)

- **[2025-03-17]**
  - Reverted Header component to original styling as per user preference
  - Completed About component update with token system
  - Replaced all hardcoded values in About component with spacing, typography, and shadow tokens
  - Improved responsive behavior using breakpoint mixins
  - Fixed SCSS syntax issues in media queries
  - Updated activeContext.md to reflect current progress

## Key Insights From Recent Work

1. **Balancing Consistency and Aesthetics**: We've discovered that some components have specific styling requirements that work better with hardcoded values rather than tokens. We need to balance system consistency with aesthetic preferences.

2. **Component Update Process**: The About component took approximately 2 hours to update completely, which is faster than anticipated. This suggests we can accelerate our timeline for remaining components.

3. **Responsive Design**: Using the breakpoint mixins significantly improved code readability and maintenance. We should continue using these consistently across components where possible.

4. **Shadow Implementation**: The component-shadow system worked very well for providing consistent shadows across different states (default, hover, active).

## Blocking Issues

1. **Glass Effect Implementation** (Priority: High)
   - Need to standardize glass effect implementation across components
   - Currently using component-specific variables
   - **Next step**: Create a dedicated glass effect mixin in the token system

2. **Shadow Performance** (Priority: Medium)
   - Box-shadow implementation causing minor performance issues on mobile
   - **Next step**: Test alternative shadow approaches with fewer blur values

## Next Steps (Next 48 Hours)

1. **Start Portfolio Component Update** (March 18-19, 2025)
   - Audit all hardcoded values
   - Create implementation plan
   - Update component structure to use token system

2. **Continue Animation Utility Classes** (March 17-19, 2025)
   - Complete fade animation implementations
   - Start work on slide animations
   - Create animation documentation

3. **Create Glass Effect Mixin** (March 17-18, 2025)
   - Standardize glass effect implementation
   - Create consistent variables for blur, background, and border
   - Add documentation
