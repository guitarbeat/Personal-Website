4. `src/sass/_base.scss` - Updated to use tokens instead of hardcoded values
5. `src/sass/_breakpoints.scss` - Updated to use tokens instead of hardcoded values
6. `src/sass/_variables.scss` - Added deprecation notice and token imports
7. `src/sass/theme/_theme-switch.scss` - Updated to use tokens for breakpoints
8. `src/sass/theme/_vignette.scss` - Updated to use tokens for colors, breakpoints, and z-index
9. `src/sass/theme/_keyframes.scss` - Updated to use tokens for colors and animations
10. `src/components/Tools/shared/styles/index.scss` - Updated to use tokens for spacing, colors, and breakpoints, added missing fullscreen mixins, responsive grid, loading and error state mixins
11. `src/components/Tools/styles/index.scss` - Fixed keyframes, wrapped declarations, and removed duplicate mixins

14. `src/components/Tools/ConflictMediation/styles/conflict-mediation.scss` - Updated to use tokens for spacing, colors, typography, and transitions

## Next Steps
1. Complete Phase 1 of the variable standardization plan
   - Update remaining component styles to use tokens where appropriate
   - Test the new token system to ensure it works correctly
   - Verify that the site renders correctly with the new tokens

2. Begin Phase 2 of the variable standardization plan
   - Create a comprehensive spacing system
   - Develop a typography system with clear roles
   - Implement a shadow system with consistent elevations

3. Complete the integration of Tools styles with main SASS architecture
   - Standardize CSS variable usage across all tools
   - Implement consistent theme handling for light/dark modes
   - Refactor remaining component styles to use shared patterns

4. Enhance mobile responsiveness for all tools
5. Implement performance optimizations
6. Improve accessibility features

## Implementation Plan for Variable Standardization

### Phase 1: Consolidation (Weeks 1-2) - IN PROGRESS
- âœ… Create a new `_tokens.scss` file to serve as the single source of truth
- âœ… Consolidate all theme colors into this file
- âœ… Unify the breakpoint system
- âœ… Standardize transitions and animations
