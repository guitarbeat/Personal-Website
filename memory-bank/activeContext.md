## Current Focus
We are currently implementing Phase 2 of the SASS Variable Standardization project. This phase focuses on creating enhanced systems for spacing, typography, and shadows, along with comprehensive function and mixin libraries and utility classes.

### Core Systems Implementation
We have successfully implemented the core systems for Phase 2:
- Enhanced spacing system with structured scale and component-specific tokens
- Enhanced typography system with modular type scale and typography roles
- Enhanced shadow system with elevation levels and theme-aware shadows

### Function and Mixin Libraries
We have created dedicated files for each system:
- `_spacing.scss`: Functions and mixins for accessing and applying spacing values
- `_typography.scss`: Functions and mixins for accessing and applying typography styles
- `_shadows.scss`: Functions and mixins for accessing and applying shadow values

### Utility Classes
We have implemented comprehensive utility classes for each system:
- `utilities/_spacing.scss`: Utility classes for padding, margin, and gap
- `utilities/_typography.scss`: Utility classes for headings, text styles, and font properties
- `utilities/_shadows.scss`: Utility classes for elevation shadows, component shadows, and interactive shadows

## Recent Changes
- **[2023-07-22]** - Fixed SASS deprecation warnings in ConflictMediation component by removing unnecessary `& {}` wrappers
- **[2023-07-22]** - Fixed undefined mixin error in _utilities.scss by adding the missing mixins import
- **[2023-07-22]** - Fixed SASS compilation error by separating legacy typography styles into a new file
- **[2023-07-22]** - Fixed remaining deprecation warnings in ConflictMediation component by properly nesting declarations
- **[2023-07-21]** - Implemented enhanced spacing system with structured scale and component-specific tokens

## Next Steps
1. **Component Updates**: Update components to use the new token system
2. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive documentation for the design token system
3. **Responsive Enhancements**: Enhance the breakpoint system with contextual breakpoints
4. **Animation System**: Implement a comprehensive animation library

## Active Decisions
- **Component-Specific Tokens**: We've decided to create component-specific tokens for common UI patterns to ensure consistency across similar components.
- **Utility-First Approach**: We're adopting a utility-first approach for common styling needs, while still maintaining component-specific styles for more complex patterns.
- **Theme-Aware Shadows**: We've implemented a theme-aware shadow system that adapts based on light or dark theme.
- **Responsive Typography**: We've implemented both fluid and breakpoint-based responsive typography to provide flexibility for different use cases.

## Open Questions
- **Component Adoption Strategy**: What's the best approach for updating existing components to use the new token system?
- **Documentation Format**: Should we create a separate documentation site for the design token system, or include it in the existing documentation?
- **Responsive Strategy**: How should we handle responsive design at the component level vs. the page level?
- **Animation Integration**: How should we integrate the animation system with the existing transition system?
