## Current Focus

We are currently implementing Phase 2 of the SASS Variable Standardization project. This phase focuses on creating enhanced systems for spacing, typography, and shadows, along with comprehensive function and mixin libraries and utility classes.

## Phase 2 Implementation Review

### Completed Work

We have successfully implemented the core systems for Phase 2 of the SASS Variable Standardization project:

1. **Enhanced Spacing System**
   - Created a structured spacing scale with a non-linear progression based on 4px units
   - Implemented semantic spacing tokens for common UI patterns
   - Defined component-specific spacing tokens for consistent component styling
   - Created responsive spacing tokens that adapt based on viewport size
   - Implemented comprehensive functions and mixins for accessing and applying spacing values
   - Created utility classes for common spacing needs (padding, margin, gap)

2. **Enhanced Typography System**
   - Implemented a modular type scale with a ratio of 1.25
   - Defined semantic type sizes for common UI patterns
   - Created typography roles with detailed styles for headings and text
   - Implemented both fluid and breakpoint-based responsive typography
   - Established a vertical rhythm system for consistent spacing
   - Created functions and mixins for accessing and applying typography styles
   - Implemented utility classes for typography needs (headings, text styles, font properties)

3. **Enhanced Shadow System**
   - Created an elevation system with corresponding shadows
   - Implemented theme-aware shadows that adapt to light/dark themes
   - Defined component-specific shadows for consistent styling
   - Created state-based shadows for interactive elements
   - Implemented inner shadows for depth and dimension
   - Created functions and mixins for accessing and applying shadow values
   - Implemented utility classes for shadow needs (elevation, component, interactive)

4. **Utility Classes Organization**
   - Created dedicated files for each system's utility classes
   - Organized utilities by category for better maintainability
   - Consolidated utilities into a single index file for easy importing
   - Ensured consistent naming conventions across all utility classes

### Next Steps

To complete Phase 2 of the SASS Variable Standardization project, we need to:

1. **Component Updates**
   - Identify components that would benefit most from the new token system
   - Create a prioritized list of components to update
   - Develop a strategy for updating components (all at once vs. incremental)
   - Begin updating components to use the new token system

2. **Documentation**
   - Create comprehensive documentation for each system
   - Develop usage guidelines and examples
   - Document the utility classes and their applications
   - Create a style guide showcasing the new systems

3. **Responsive Enhancements**
   - Enhance the breakpoint system with contextual breakpoints
   - Develop mixins for common responsive patterns
   - Create a container query approach for component-level responsiveness

4. **Animation System**
   - Create a comprehensive animation library
   - Define standard durations and easing functions
   - Implement a system for managing animation complexity
   - Create animation utility classes

### Implementation Strategy

For the remaining work, we will follow this strategy:

1. **Component Updates**: Start with the most frequently used components and those with the most inconsistent styling. Update them incrementally to minimize disruption.

2. **Documentation**: Create documentation alongside component updates to ensure accurate and up-to-date information.

3. **Responsive Enhancements**: Implement these after component updates to ensure they address actual needs identified during the update process.

4. **Animation System**: Implement this last, as it builds upon the other systems and requires them to be stable.

## Active Decisions

- **Component-Specific Tokens**: We've decided to create component-specific tokens for common UI patterns to ensure consistency across similar components.
- **Utility-First Approach**: We're adopting a utility-first approach for common styling needs, while still maintaining component-specific styles for more complex patterns.
- **Theme-Aware Shadows**: We've implemented a theme-aware shadow system that adapts based on light or dark theme.
- **Responsive Typography**: We've implemented both fluid and breakpoint-based responsive typography to provide flexibility for different use cases.

## Open Questions

- **Component Adoption Strategy**: What's the best approach for updating existing components to use the new token system?
- **Documentation Format**: Should we create a separate documentation site for the design token system, or include it in the existing documentation?
- **Responsive Strategy**: How should we handle responsive design at the component level vs. the page level?
- **Animation Integration**: How should we integrate the animation system with the existing transition system?
