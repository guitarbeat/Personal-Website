# Build Fixes Applied

## 🚨 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Import Path Error** ✅
**Error**: `Module not found: Error: Can't resolve '../../utils/throttle' in '/vercel/path0/src/components/effects/Moiree'`

**Root Cause**: Incorrect relative import path in `src/components/effects/Moiree/Moiree.js`

**Fix Applied**:
```javascript
// Before (incorrect)
import { throttle } from "../../utils/throttle";

// After (correct)
import { throttle } from "../../../utils/throttle";
```

**Explanation**: The Moiree component is located at `src/components/effects/Moiree/` and needs to go up 3 levels to reach `src/utils/throttle.js`:
- `../` (up from Moiree/)
- `../` (up from effects/)
- `../` (up from components/)
- `utils/throttle` (into utils folder)

### 2. **Node.js Version Warning** ✅
**Warning**: `Node.js version 18.x is deprecated. Deployments created on or after 2025-09-01 will fail to build.`

**Fix Applied**: Added engines field to `package.json`:
```json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": "22.x"
  }
}
```

## ✅ Verification

All import paths have been verified:

1. **`src/components/effects/Moiree/Moiree.js`** ✅
   - `import { throttle } from "../../../utils/throttle";`

2. **`src/components/effects/Blur/scrollSpeed.ts`** ✅
   - `import { throttleTS } from "../../../utils/throttle";`

3. **`src/components/content/Projects/Projects.js`** ✅
   - `import { generateItemColors } from "../../../utils/colorUtils";`

4. **`src/components/content/NavBar/NavBar.js`** ✅
   - `import { useScrollThreshold } from "../../../hooks/useScrollThreshold";`

## 🚀 Expected Results

- ✅ Build should now complete successfully
- ✅ No more module resolution errors
- ✅ Node.js version warning resolved
- ✅ All refactored utilities properly imported

## 📝 Notes

- All import paths follow the pattern: `../../../` to go up from component directories to `src/`
- Node.js 22.x is the current LTS version and recommended for production
- The build cache will be cleared on next deployment to ensure clean build
