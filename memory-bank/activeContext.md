## Current Focus

Working on improving the Tools section implementation, ensuring consistent font sizes across card components, addressing SASS architecture improvements, and fixing code quality issues including ESLint warnings.

## Recent Changes

- **2024-03-21**: Fixed ESLint warnings in ToolsSection.js by:
  - Removed unused variants object
  - Removed duplicate FullscreenIcon and ExitFullscreenIcon components
  - Made isUnlocked variable usage more explicit with toolsAccessible
- **2024-03-21**: Fixed mixed declarations in `conflict-mediation.scss`
- **2024-03-21**: Updated breakpoint usage from `bp.respond` to `mix.respond`
- **2024-03-21**: Standardized glass-effect implementation across components
- **2024-03-21**: Updated color function usage to modern syntax

## Next Steps

1. Standardize card font sizes across the site using the design token system
2. Continue improving the Tools section implementation with better organization and performance
3. Create consistent styling patterns for interactive components
4. Review and update remaining mixed declarations in SCSS files
5. Standardize responsive breakpoint implementation across all components
6. Enhance glass-morphism effect consistency
7. Optimize theme transition performance
8. Document updated SASS patterns and best practices
9. Fix remaining ESLint warnings in other files
