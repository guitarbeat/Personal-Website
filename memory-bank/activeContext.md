# Active Context: Personal Website

## Current Focus
- Resolving runtime errors and improving resource management
- Implementing proper cleanup for tools and components
- Maintaining consistent code style and organization
- Optimizing performance and user experience

## Recent Changes
- Added cleanup method to SoundManager in Snake game
- Added start method to SnakeScene class
- Fixed ESLint warnings across multiple files
- Improved code organization in Tools section
- Enhanced error handling and resource management
- Updated component naming for clarity

## Next Steps
1. Continue monitoring for potential memory leaks
2. Implement additional error boundaries where needed
3. Add comprehensive testing for tools
4. Enhance documentation for new components
5. Review and optimize performance
6. Consider adding more interactive tools

## Active Decisions
- Resource Cleanup: Implementing proper cleanup methods for all tools
- Code Organization: Maintaining consistent file structure
- Error Handling: Using error boundaries for tool components
- Performance: Using lazy loading for tool components
- Testing: Planning to add comprehensive tests

## Open Questions
- Should we add more interactive tools to the collection?
- Are there any remaining memory leaks to address?
- Can we further optimize the loading performance?
- Should we add more advanced features to existing tools?
- How can we improve the user experience further?

## Current Issues
- Monitoring for potential memory leaks
- Ensuring consistent error handling
- Optimizing tool loading times
- Maintaining code quality standards
