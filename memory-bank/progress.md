## Implementation Strategy

We are reassessing our approach to implementing the SASS variable standardization:

1. **Incremental Implementation**: Take a more gradual approach to implementing the token system.
2. **Thorough Testing**: Ensure comprehensive testing before applying changes to components.
3. **User Experience Focus**: Prioritize maintaining a consistent user experience during the transition.
4. **Selective Updates**: Carefully evaluate which components should be updated and in what order.
