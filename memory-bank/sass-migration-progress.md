# SASS Migration Progress

## Current Status

- **Phase**: Phase 2 (Variable Cleanup)
- **Last Updated**: 2024-03-18
- **Status**: Phase 1 Complete, Starting Phase 2

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Initial variable analysis
- [x] Created migration plan
- [x] Identified unused variables
- [x] Documented current state
- [x] Created variable organization structure
- [x] Phase 1: Variable Consolidation
  - [x] Consolidated breakpoint variables in `_tokens.scss`
  - [x] Consolidated transition variables in `_tokens.scss`
  - [x] Consolidated z-index variables in `_tokens.scss`
  - [x] Removed redundant imports and definitions
  - [x] Deleted `_breakpoints.scss`

## Next Steps

1. Begin Phase 2: Variable Cleanup
   - [ ] Remove deprecated variables
   - [ ] Review and update design system variables
   - [ ] Clean up theme variables

## Issues and Decisions

### Open Issues

1. Need to verify if some "unused" variables are false positives
2. Need to determine if any variables are used in JavaScript files
3. Need to verify impact on build process

### Decisions Made

1. Using `_tokens.scss` as single source of truth for design tokens
2. Adopting SASS modules pattern
3. Moving to a more structured file organization
4. Removed `_breakpoints.scss` as its functionality is now in `_tokens.scss`
5. Commented out exported variables in `_base.scss` and `_variables.scss` for JavaScript use (may need review)

## Variables to Watch

Variables that need special attention during migration:

### Duplicates Consolidated

```scss
// Breakpoints consolidated in _tokens.scss
$breakpoints: (
  'largest': $bp-largest,   // 1200px
  'large': $bp-large,       // 1000px
  'medium': $bp-medium,     // 800px
  'small': $bp-small,       // 600px
  'smallest': $bp-smallest  // 500px
);

// Transitions already well-structured in _tokens.scss
$transitions: (
  'duration': (...),
  'timing': (...)
);

// Z-index already well-structured in _tokens.scss
$z-index: (
  'base': 1,
  'tooltip': 10,
  ...
);
```

### Potentially Unused (Verify Before Removing)

```scss
// Design System
$component-shadows
$component-spacing
$semantic-spacing
$semantic-type-scale

// Legacy
$shadow-light
$shadow-medium
$theme-transition-properties
$transition-duration-long

// Animations
$bounce-out
$smooth-out
```

## Audit Log

### 2024-03-18

- Created migration plan
- Identified 34 potentially unused variables
- Documented current variable organization
- Created progress tracking system
- Completed Phase 1: Variable Consolidation
  - Consolidated breakpoint variables
  - Consolidated transition variables
  - Consolidated z-index variables
  - Removed redundant definitions
  - Deleted `_breakpoints.scss`

## Notes

- Keep this file updated as migration progresses
- Document any issues or roadblocks encountered
- Track any decisions made during implementation
- Note any variables that require special handling
- Some JavaScript exports were commented out during consolidation - need to review impact
