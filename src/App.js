                I am a second-year doctoral student working in a functional
                optics lab that develops and deploys imaging technologies for
                the study of neurovascular physiology and disease. Through the
                use of computational approaches, I am investigating ways to
                improve the qualitative and quantitative analysis of data
                received from various imaging modalities. I received my B.S. in
                Engineering Innovation and Leadership from UT El Paso.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm interested in science and engineering because it allows me
                to spend time learning new things while also allowing me to
                express myself creatively as an artist. In my free time, I enjoy
                playing music and exploring the outdoors.
