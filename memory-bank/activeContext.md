# Active Context: Personal Website

## Current Focus (Updated 2025-03-17)

We have reverted the recent Phase 2 changes related to blur tokens, glass effect system, and component updates. We are returning to the previous state of the project before these changes were applied. We will be reassessing the approach to the SASS Variable Standardization project.

## Immediate Tasks in Progress

1. **Reassessment of Phase 2 Approach** (Active, March 17, 2025)
   - Evaluating the appropriate timing for implementing token system changes
   - Reconsidering which components should be updated
   - Planning a more gradual approach to implementation

2. **Documentation Update** (Active, March 17, 2025)
   - Updating all documentation to reflect the reversion of changes
   - Creating a revised implementation plan
   - Clarifying goals and timelines

## Current Decisions Being Made

1. **Component-by-Component Approach** (Decision under review)
   - Reassessing which components should maintain their original styling
   - Evaluating whether a hybrid approach is appropriate

2. **Animation Performance Strategy** (Decision needed by: 2025-03-20)
   - Evaluating whether to use CSS animations or JS-based animations for complex interactions
   - Considering performance impact on mobile devices
   - Testing different approaches to find optimal solution

3. **Component Update Priority** (Decision under review)
   - Reconsidering the sequence of component updates
   - Evaluating impact on user experience during transition

4. **Documentation Format** (Decision in progress)
   - Evaluating options for documentation format (internal docs vs. style guide site)
   - Considering integration with existing documentation

## Latest Changes (Last 24 Hours)

- **[2025-03-17]**
  - Completely reverted changes made to SASS token system related to blur effects and glass effects
  - Reverted About component to its original version with no token dependencies
  - Reverted typography system modifications
  - Removed test CSS files
  - Updated Memory Bank documentation to reflect changes

## Key Insights From Recent Work

1. **Timing of Standardization**: We need to carefully consider the timing of standardization efforts to minimize disruption to the development workflow.

2. **Balancing Consistency and Aesthetics**: We've discovered that some components have specific styling requirements that work better with hardcoded values rather than tokens. We need to balance system consistency with aesthetic preferences.

3. **Incremental Approach**: Taking a more incremental approach to applying the token system may be more effective than attempting to update multiple components simultaneously.

4. **Testing Coverage**: We need to ensure comprehensive testing of any changes to the token system before applying them to components.

## Blocking Issues

1. **Shadow Performance** (Priority: Medium)
   - Box-shadow implementation causing minor performance issues on mobile
   - **Next step**: Test alternative shadow approaches with fewer blur values

## Next Steps (Next 48 Hours)

1. **Revise Phase 2 Implementation Plan** (March 18-19, 2025)
   - Create a more gradual approach to implementation
   - Identify specific goals and timelines
   - Prioritize components for updates

2. **Update Documentation** (March 18, 2025)
   - Ensure all Memory Bank documents reflect current project state
   - Create revised component update plan
   - Document lessons learned

3. **Identify Test Cases** (March 19, 2025)
   - Create test cases for token system changes
   - Establish testing protocol for future updates
   - Document testing results

## Current Focus

- Restoring the original styling and effects for the site

## Recent Changes

- **Added Theme-Aware Text Shadow**: Created a white text shadow in light mode and dark text shadow in dark mode for the header text, improving visibility and aesthetics.
- **Improved Hover State Contrast**: Modified hover colors to be darker in light mode and brighter in dark mode, providing better visual feedback and accessibility.
- **Adjusted Color Palette**: Restored the original color scheme with enhanced vibrancy - returning to a more neutral blackish dark mode and light grey light mode, blue-toned sage colors, and original coral and sand tones.
- **Enhanced Color Palette**: Revitalized the theme colors to be more vibrant and saturated, improving the overall visual appeal of the site.
- **Fixed Avatar Flickering in Header**: Resolved flickering issues with the avatar by correctly using the `--profile-pic-bg-color` theme variable instead of a hardcoded color value and improving transition performance with `will-change: opacity`.
- **Restored Enhanced About Section Styling**: Implemented sophisticated glass blur effects, gradient backgrounds, and improved animations for the About component.
- **Fixed Navbar Z-Index Layering**: Adjusted z-index values to ensure the navbar appears above the vignette blur effect (navbar: 70, vignette: 30).
- **Added Inverted Color Border**: Implemented a color-inverting border around the navbar using a new `invert-border` mixin with the mix-blend-mode: difference technique.
- **Restored Vignette Blur Effect**: Fixed the glass blur effect by restoring the original implementation of `_vignette.scss` with proper class names and mixins.
- **Updated Color Functions**: Replaced deprecated `color.channel()` functions with `color.red()`, `color.green()`, and `color.blue()` for better compatibility.
- **Reverted About Component**: Restored the original styling and functionality of the About component per user feedback.
- **Reverted SASS Token System Changes**: Rolled back changes made during the SASS Variable Standardization project (Phase 2) to restore the original styling.

## Next Steps

- Verify all original visual effects are working correctly
- Consider more incremental, focused approach to code improvements
- Ensure compatibility with existing components before making changes
